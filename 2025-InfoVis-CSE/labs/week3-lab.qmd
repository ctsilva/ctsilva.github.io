### Today's Lab Activities

1. Warm up: Practice with Scenarios & Choices
2. Creating multiple chart types in Vega-Lite
3. Exploring encoding alternatives for same data
4. Small multiples and faceting
5. Combining multiple views

## Recall Today's Main Topics:

## Part 1: Warm Up - Thinking about Design Choices (~5-10 mins)

### Our Task:

::::{.incremental}
- **What we're given**: A data scenario & a goal in mind
- **Our task**: Answer, collectively, the optimal way to:
  1. Identify the data domains [Q, C, O, T, Spatial (S)]
  2. Graph the data [Bar, Line, Scatter, Matrix, Symbol]

### Exercise 4

- **What we're given:** Test scores (0%-100%) of students plotted against hours studied.
- **Goal:** Determine the correlation between study time and performance.

## Exercises - Answers

::::{.incremental}

### Exercise 1: Monthly Sale Revenues
- **Data domains**: _Monthly Sales_ (Q) over _12 months_ (T/O)
- **Graph**: _Line_ or _Bar_

### Exercise 2: Population Sizes
- **Data domains**: _Population Size_ (Q) by _Country_ (S)
- **Graph**: _Symbol Map_ (via GeoData)

### Exercise 3: Product Ratings
- **Data domains**: A _collection_ (Q) of _Product Ratings_ (O)
- **Graph**: _Bar Chart_

### Exercise 4: Test Scores
- **Data domains**: _Test scores_ (Q) vs. _hours studied_ (Q)
- **Graph**: _Scatter Plot_

## Part 2: Multiple Chart Types in Vega-Lite

### Documentation
We've already covered several plot types, but Vega-Lite provides a very wide variety of [different chart types](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/).

<br />

### Changes to our Approach
- Moving away from specifying "answer" graphs
- Instead, moving more towards prompt-based questions and analysis. 

## Part 2 Exercises: Answering Prompts (~20-30 mins)

### Your Task:

**IN PAIRS OF TWO:**

> For each scenario prompt, take the data and attempt to generate a visualization of your choice that shows something unique about that dataset.
> At the end of this exercise, we will have volunteers show their graphs for each scenario and provide a narrative for what the graph is telling them.

- You are allowed to use any visualization.
- Feel free to use any filters or calculations
- Use the cheatsheet to help you identify optimal graphs, scales, and transformations.
- Try to avoid the common pitfalls:
  - **Skipping data exploration:** Visualize without understanding the data
  - **Chart junk:** Adding visual elements that don’t encode information
  - **Color overuse:** Using color when position would be more effective
  - **Ignoring scale effects:** Not considering how scale choices affect perception
  - **3D when 2D suffices:** Adding dimensions that don’t encode information
- Keep it simple!

## Part 3: Facets and Multiple Views

### Context:
In prior labs and exercises, we touched upon the idea of "_facets_", or multiple views within a single chart. Facets allow us to divide visualizations based on a categorical feature as a 3rd dimension.

In this part, we'll really get deep into generating **multi-view compositions**.

<br />

### Concepts Covered:

- _layer_: place compatible charts directly on top of each other,
- _facet_: partition data into multiple charts, organized in rows or columns,
- _concatenate_: position arbitrary charts within a shared layout, and
- _repeat_: take a base chart specification and apply it to multiple data fields.
