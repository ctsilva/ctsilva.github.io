## What is Temporal Data?

**Definition**: Data in which values depend on time and time is explicitly recorded.

In other words: we track **when** things happened or **what values were** at specific points in time

::: notes
- This is a fundamental concept - time is not just an attribute, it's THE organizing dimension
- **START WITH THIS QUESTION**: "What datasets have you used or seen that have time in them?"
  - Get 3-4 student examples on the board
  - For each example, ask: "How is time recorded? What's the granularity?"
- Emphasize that temporal data requires explicit time recording - not just "ordered" data
- Common misconception: Students often think any sequential data is temporal (e.g., ranking lists)
- Key distinction: Temporal data has meaningful time stamps/intervals, not just ordering
:::

---

## Example: Temporal Dataset Structure

![Image](figs/week11/temporal-dataset-structure.png)

**Why is this temporal data?**

- **DAT** and **TIME** columns explicitly record when events occurred
- Each row represents an **incident/event** at a specific location and time
- Can analyze patterns: when, where, and how frequently events happen

::: notes
- This appears to be crime or incident data - good real-world example
- **PHYSICALLY POINT** to the DAT and TIME columns on screen with mouse/pointer
  - "See these columns? This is what makes this temporal data - explicit timestamps"
  - Make sure image is zoomed/large enough for back row to see
- Note the other attributes (location, type) that we might want to analyze over time
- Questions to pose: "What patterns might we want to find? Daily patterns? Seasonal? Hot spots over time?"
  - Wait for answers - students might suggest: "crime by hour of day", "seasonal trends", "geographic patterns over time"
- This is event data (discrete occurrences) rather than continuous measurements
:::

---

## Application Domains

- Business
- Natural Phenomena
- Behaviors/Movement
- Traffic/Mobility
- Medical/Healthcare
- Finance

::: notes
- Temporal data is EVERYWHERE - this is one of the most common data types
- Ask students to give specific examples for each domain:
  - Business: Sales trends, customer activity, website traffic
  - Natural Phenomena: Weather, earthquakes, climate change
  - Behaviors/Movement: GPS tracks, social media activity, eye tracking
  - Traffic/Mobility: Vehicle flow, public transit usage, flight patterns
  - Medical: Patient vitals, disease progression, treatment outcomes
  - Finance: Stock prices, trading volume, economic indicators
- Emphasize: Different domains have different temporal characteristics (irregular vs regular sampling, event-based vs continuous)
:::

---

## Type 1: Event Data

**Time + Object (Attributes)**

"Something happened at time T"

Examples: Tweet, Email, Alarm

::: notes
- CRITICAL distinction: Event data represents discrete occurrences at points in time
- Events often have irregular timing - they happen when they happen (not sampled at regular intervals)
- Each event is an object with attributes (who, what, where, why)
- Examples to emphasize:
  - Tweet: timestamp + user + text + location
  - Email: sent time + sender + recipient + subject
  - Alarm: trigger time + sensor + type + severity
- Key visualization challenge: How do we show when events occurred and their attributes?
- Often visualized as dots, marks, or bars on a timeline
:::

---

## Type 2: Measurement Data

**Time + Measure(s)**

"This is the value at time T"

Examples: Temperature, revenue, stock value

::: notes
- **EXPLICIT CONTRAST WITH TYPE 1**: "Remember Event Data? Tweet, Email, Alarm - something just *happened*. Measurement data is different - we're recording a *value* at each time point."
- Measurement data: Continuous or regularly sampled values over time
- Unlike events (which happen irregularly), measurements are typically taken at regular intervals
- Each measurement records one or more quantitative values at a timestamp
- **Side-by-side comparison to emphasize**:
  - Event: "Email sent at 3:42 PM" (binary - it happened)
  - Measurement: "Temperature was 72°F at 3:42 PM" (quantitative value)
- Examples to discuss:
  - Temperature: Recorded every hour → time series of temperature values
  - Revenue: Daily sales figures → continuous tracking of performance
  - Stock value: Price sampled every second during trading hours
- Key difference from events: We care about the VALUE at each time point, not just that something occurred
- Primary visualization: Line charts, area charts - showing how values change over time
- This is what most people think of as "time series data"
:::

---

## Temporal Information Components

**Time = Position + Interval + Granularity**

- **Position**: When did it occur? (specific timestamp)
- **Interval**: For how long? (duration)
- **Granularity**: At what scale? (seconds, hours, days, years)

**Example**: A meeting starts at 2:00 PM (position), lasts 90 minutes (interval), measured in minutes (granularity)

::: notes
- These three components help us fully characterize temporal data
- **Position (When)**: The anchor point in time - can be absolute (Jan 1, 2025, 3:00 PM) or relative (3 hours ago)
- **Interval (Duration)**: How long something lasted - critical for event data with duration (meetings, system outages, sessions)
  - Point events have duration ≈ 0
  - Interval events have meaningful duration
- **Granularity (Scale)**: The resolution at which we're measuring/recording time
  - Affects what patterns we can see (hourly data can't show minute-level patterns)
  - Choice of granularity is a design decision - finer = more detail but more data
- Example: "Meeting from 2:00-3:30 PM" has position (2:00 PM), interval (90 min), granularity (minutes)
- These components influence visualization choices
:::

---

## Time Structures

Three key structures for temporal data:

1. **Sequential** - Linear progression over time
2. **Cyclic** - Repeating patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal)
3. **Hierarchical** - Nested time resolutions (year/month/day)

**Key insight**: Most real temporal data has ALL THREE structures simultaneously!

::: notes
- These are the three fundamental ways time can be structured in data
- **Sequential**: Time flows in one direction - useful for showing trends, growth, changes
  - Example: Company revenue from 2015-2025
- **Cyclic**: Patterns repeat on a regular basis - reveals rhythms and regularities
  - Example: Traffic by hour of day, sales by day of week, temperature by season
  - Natural cycles: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
- **Hierarchical**: Multiple nested time scales - enables drill-down and multi-resolution analysis
  - Example: Years contain quarters contain months contain weeks contain days
- **EMPHASIZE THIS POINT**: "Most real temporal data has ALL THREE structures simultaneously!"
  - Example: Website traffic has sequential trends (growing over years), cyclic patterns (weekday vs weekend), and hierarchical structure (hour/day/week/month)
  - You choose which structure to visualize based on your question
- Visualization choice depends on which structure you want to emphasize
:::

---

## Sequential and Cyclic Patterns

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Sequential**

(Jan 1, … , Dec 31)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cyclic**

(S, M, T, W, T, F, S)
:::
:::


---

## Hierarchical Time Resolutions

**Multiple Resolutions**

- Years
- Months
- Weeks
- Days
- Hours


---

## Linking Data Types to Time Structures

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Event Data**

Time + Object (Attributes)

- Sequential: Transaction logs over years
- Cyclic: User logins by day of week
- Hierarchical: System alerts by hour/day/month
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Measurement Data**

Time + Measure(s)

- Sequential: Stock prices over time (line charts)
- Cyclic: Temperature patterns by season
- Hierarchical: Revenue by year/quarter/month
:::
:::

**Key Insight**: Data type + time structure → visualization choice

::: notes
- **NOW we can synthesize**: You've seen Event vs Measurement AND Sequential/Cyclic/Hierarchical
- This slide connects the two fundamental concepts: data types AND time structures
- Both event and measurement data can have sequential, cyclic, or hierarchical patterns
- The combination determines the best visualization approach
- Sequential structure → line charts, area charts (show progression)
- Cyclic structure → radial layouts, calendars (emphasize repetition)
- Hierarchical structure → multi-scale views, drill-down interactions
- Ask students: "If you have daily website traffic, what structures might you see?" (Answer: Sequential trend over months, cyclic pattern by day of week, hierarchical hour/day/week)
:::

---

## Aggregation Trade-offs

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Benefits of Aggregation**

- Reduces noise
- Shows overall trends
- Manageable data size
- Clearer patterns

*Example*: Daily → Monthly averages reveals seasonal trends
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Risks of Aggregation**

- Masks short-term events
- Loses extreme values
- Can hide critical peaks
- **Simpson's Paradox**

*Example*: A 1-hour server outage disappears in monthly view
:::
:::

**Design principle**: Choose granularity based on the questions you need to answer

**Warning**: This is Simpson's Paradox for temporal data - aggregation can completely reverse or hide patterns!

::: notes
- **CRITICAL SLIDE** - This is Simpson's paradox for temporal data!
- Aggregation is necessary (can't show raw data at finest granularity) BUT dangerous
- Benefits are obvious - reduced noise, clearer trends, manageable visualization
- But risks are severe - can completely hide important events
- **Real example to share**: Netflix outage for 1 hour affects millions, but disappears in daily/weekly aggregates
- **Another example**: Daily COVID cases show spikes, but monthly averages smooth them out - which matters for policy?
- The "right" aggregation depends on your analytical question:
  - Looking for long-term trends? → Aggregate more
  - Looking for anomalies/outliers? → Aggregate less
- Best practice: Provide interactive controls to change aggregation level
- Mention multi-resolution techniques (coming later): horizon charts, overview+detail

## Example: Sales Over Time - Sequential View

Sequential: "How did our sales change over the years?"


![Image](figs/week11/sales-sequential-view.png)

---

## Example: Sales Over Time - Cyclic View

"How does the number of orders change by day of the week?"


![Image](figs/week11/sales-cyclic-view.png)

---

## Hierarchical Structure and Resolution

Combining multiple time resolutions in one view


---

## Time Resolution: Sequential Views

Different temporal granularities reveal different patterns in sequential data

![Image](figs/week11/time-resolution-sequential-1.png)

![Image](figs/week11/time-resolution-sequential-2.png)

---

## Time Resolution: Cyclic Views

Choosing the right resolution (hourly, daily, weekly) affects what patterns emerge

![Image](figs/week11/time-resolution-cyclic-1.png)

![Image](figs/week11/time-resolution-cyclic-2.png)

---

## Example: Nesting Cyclic (Day) within Sequential (Year)

Each row = one year, columns = days of week, showing how daily patterns evolve annually

![Image](figs/week11/nesting-cyclic-in-sequential.png)

---

## Example: Nested Time Patterns (Quarterly)

Days within weeks within quarters - revealing both micro and macro patterns

![Image](figs/week11/nested-quarterly-patterns.png)

---

# Visualization Methods

Line charts, area charts, and their variations

---

## Line Charts: Time + Quantity

The fundamental temporal visualization: position encodes both time (x) and values (y)

![Image](figs/week11/line-chart-basic.png)

# Aspect Ratio

How chart dimensions affect perception

**Definition**: Aspect Ratio = Width / Height


---

## Impact on Trend Visibility

Different ratios make trends more or less visible


![Image](figs/week11/aspect-ratio-impact.png)

---

## Perceptual Principle: Slope Judgment

**Key finding**: Humans judge slopes most accurately at 45°

- Too shallow (<< 45°): Hard to distinguish small differences
- Too steep (>> 45°): Also difficult to compare
- **Optimal: ~45°** - Maximum perceptual sensitivity

This principle guides aspect ratio selection

::: notes
- **Fundamental perceptual principle** from Cleveland & McGill's research
- Our visual system is optimized for judging slopes near 45 degrees
- Demo: Show how very flat lines (<10°) make it hard to see if trend is up or down
- Demo: Show how very steep lines (>80°) also make comparison difficult
- This isn't arbitrary - it's based on empirical perceptual experiments
- Practical implication: Don't just use default aspect ratios from your plotting library!
- The aspect ratio is a design parameter that affects what viewers perceive
- Ask: "Which stock would you invest in based on this chart?" - then show same data with different aspect ratio revealing different impression
:::

---

## Banking to 45°

**Method**: Set aspect ratio so that the average slope is 45°

Ensures trends are perceptually salient and comparable

:::


---

## Example: Banking to 45° Comparison

Same data, different aspect ratios - which reveals patterns best?

![Image](figs/week11/banking-45-comparison-3.png)

---

## Best Practice

**Rule of thumb**: Always test different aspect ratios to see which one best conveys your message


---

---

## Multiple Line Charts: Adding Categories

Encoding categorical data with color/line style to compare multiple time series

![Image](figs/week11/multiple-line-charts.png)

---

## The "Spaghetti Plot" Problem

It does not scale!


![Image](figs/week11/spaghetti-plot.png)

::: notes
- Classic problem in temporal visualization - too many lines creates visual chaos
- With 50+ lines, you can't distinguish individual series
- Lines occlude each other - can't see what's underneath
- Colors become indistinguishable - limited palette
- Called "spaghetti plot" because it looks like tangled pasta!
- Ask students: "Have you seen plots like this? What questions CAN you answer? What can't you answer?"
- Can answer: Overall envelope, outliers, general trend
- Cannot answer: Specific values for individual series, comparisons between specific pairs
- This motivates the solutions on next slides: grouping, filtering, highlighting, small multiples
- Real-world example: Stock market with hundreds of stocks - spaghetti plot is useless
:::

---

## Solutions for Multiple Lines

Possible Solutions ...
1. Grouping
2. Filtering/Focus
3. Highlighting


---

## Comparison: Grouping, Filtering, Highlighting

**Grouping**

**Highlighting**
![](figs/week11/comparison-highlighting.png)
:::
:::

---

## Small Multiples

Small Multiple Line Charts and Area Charts

::: notes
- Small multiples = static solution to spaghetti plots
- But note: Filtering and Highlighting are often INTERACTIVE techniques
- This leads us to the next major topic: Interaction
- **Transition**: "We've seen static solutions - but in practice, filtering and highlighting are interactive. Let's talk about interaction techniques for temporal data..."
:::

---

## Example: Small Multiple Line Charts

Separate panels for each series - easier to see individual patterns

![Image](figs/week11/small-multiples-line.png)

---

## Example: Small Multiple Area Charts

Area encoding helps emphasize magnitude while maintaining separate views

![Image](figs/week11/small-multiples-area.png)

---

## Area Charts for Proportions

Useful to depict proportion changes over time


![Image](figs/week11/area-chart-proportions.png)

---

## Stacked Area Charts: Limitations

**"Baseline Bias"** - only the baseline layer is easy to read accurately

Problem: Temporal trends for upper layers are hard to interpret because they don't share a common baseline


![Image](figs/week11/stacked-area-baseline-bias-1.png)

![Image](figs/week11/stacked-area-baseline-bias-2.png)

::: notes
- **IMPORTANT PERCEPTUAL LIMITATION** - students often misuse stacked area charts
- The bottom layer (touching x-axis) is easy to read - it has a stable baseline
- But upper layers "float" on changing baselines - very hard to judge their values or trends
- **INTERACTIVE DEMO**: Point to an upper layer (e.g., green category) and ask:
  - "Did this category increase or decrease between these two time points?"
  - "Can anyone tell me the actual value for this category in Q3?"
  - Students will struggle - this proves the baseline bias!
  - Then show: Only the bottom layer can be read accurately
- The total height is easy to read, but individual layer trends are ambiguous
- Example: If bottom layer increases sharply, upper layers appear to go up even if their actual values are flat
- When to use: When you care about total AND composition, and bottom layer is most important
- When NOT to use: When you need to compare trends across all categories
- Better alternatives: Small multiples (separate charts), normalized stacked (next slide), or just don't stack
- Real example: COVID dashboards with stacked areas - very misleading for comparing different variants
:::

## Normalized Stacked Area Charts

# Interaction Techniques

Critical for exploring temporal data


---

## Why Interaction Matters for Temporal Data

**Challenge**: Time series data is often too large or complex to understand in a single static view

**Solution**: Interactive techniques allow users to:

- Navigate through time (zoom, pan)
- Focus on specific patterns or events
- Link multiple views for comparison
- Dynamically adjust aggregation levels


---

## Zoom and Pan

**Purpose**: Navigate dense sequential time series

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Semantic Zoom**

- Change level of detail
- Hourly → Daily → Monthly
- Preserve context
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Geometric Zoom**

- Magnify visual space
- See more detail
- Focus + context techniques
:::
:::

**Example**: Stock chart with overview + detail panes

::: notes
- Two fundamentally different types of zoom - students often confuse these!
- **LINK BACK**: "Remember our Aggregation Trade-offs slide? Semantic zoom is interactive aggregation!"
- **Semantic Zoom** = change aggregation level (connect back to earlier aggregation slide)
  - Zoom out: Hourly → Daily (aggregate 24 hours into 1 point)
  - Zoom in: Daily → Hourly (show finer resolution)
  - Data actually changes - different level of detail
  - **This lets you explore different aggregation levels interactively** rather than committing to one upfront
  - Example: Google Maps showing cities vs streets vs buildings
- **Geometric Zoom** = magnify the view (like a magnifying glass)
  - Same data points, just bigger
  - Doesn't change aggregation, just visual scale
  - Example: Zoom into a region of a line chart to see fluctuations better
- Best practice: Combine both - overview + detail where overview provides context
- Example to show: Stock charts with small overview at bottom + zoomed detail above
- Interaction: Brushing in overview selects region shown in detail
:::

---

## Filtering and Brushing

**Filtering**: Show/hide data based on criteria

- Time range selection
- Category filtering (e.g., show only certain products)
- Threshold filtering (e.g., values > X)

**Brushing**: Select data in one view, highlight in others

- **Temporal brushing**: Select time range, see corresponding events
- **Linked views**: Brush on map → highlight in timeline


---

## Brushing & Linking Example

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**View 1**: Geographic map

User brushes (selects) a region
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**View 2**: Time series

Corresponding temporal data highlights automatically
:::
:::

**Power**: Discover spatio-temporal patterns (e.g., "Sales peak in Region A during Q4")

::: notes
- **LIVE DEMO OPPORTUNITY**: If you have a prepared D3 example, Tableau dashboard, or Observable notebook, SHOW THIS LIVE
  - Static images can't convey the interactivity
  - Seeing the linking happen in real-time is 100x more impactful
  - Even a simple example (brush a time range, see map update) will make this memorable
- If no live demo available: At minimum, verbally walk through the interaction
  - "Imagine I click and drag on the map to select this region..."
  - "...instantly, the time series highlights just those data points"
  - "Now I can see: this region has a spike every December"
- This is the payoff of brushing & linking - cross-view pattern discovery
:::

---

## Dynamic Aggregation

**Interactive granularity control**

Users adjust time resolution on-the-fly:

- Slider: "Show me data aggregated by: Hour / Day / Week / Month"
- Drill-down: Click on a month → see daily breakdown
- Roll-up: Aggregate noisy hourly data to daily averages

**Advanced**: Time-series bagging, dynamic binning for very long series


---

## Time Warping and Distortion

**Fisheye/distortion**:

- Focus region shows detail
- Context regions compressed
- Maintains overview while examining specifics

**Time-warping**:

- Align periodic patterns despite phase shifts
- Dynamic time warping (DTW) for comparing similar patterns
- Useful for comparing multiple time series with lag


---

## Best Practices for Interaction Design

1. **Provide overview first**: Show full temporal extent
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, reveal detail on demand
3. **Maintain context**: Always show where you are in time
4. **Link multiple views**: Connect temporal, spatial, and categorical views
5. **Smooth transitions**: Animate changes to maintain mental model
6. **Direct manipulation**: Let users interact with the visualization itself


---

# Event Data Visualization

Visualizing discrete events and durations


---

## Types of Event Data

**Timestamp + Event Properties**

- Incidents
- Activity Logs
- Messages (Emails, Chats, etc.)


---

## Example: Dot Plot for Events

Each dot = one event, position = time, rows = categories

![Image](figs/week11/event-dot-plot.png)

---

## Example: Proportional Symbols

Symbol size encodes additional attributes (e.g., event magnitude or importance)

![Image](figs/week11/event-proportional-symbols.png)

---

## Events with Duration

How do you visualize events that have duration?


---

## Gantt Charts

Horizontal bars show event start, duration, and end times

![Image](figs/week11/gantt-chart-intro.png)

::: notes
- **CONNECT BACK TO EVENT DATA**: "Remember our Event Data definition? Events with duration? Gantt charts are THE classic visualization for this."
- **Origin story**: Named after Henry Gantt (1910s) - originally invented for project management
  - Shows tasks, dependencies, timelines
  - Still dominates project management software (MS Project, Asana, Jira, etc.)
- **Modern applications** have expanded far beyond projects:
  - Server/system activity monitoring (next slides)
  - Resource allocation (people, machines, rooms)
  - Manufacturing schedules
  - Any scenario with concurrent activities over time
- Key visual features:
  - Time on x-axis
  - Tasks/resources on y-axis
  - Bars show start, duration, end
  - Can show dependencies with arrows
:::

---

## Example: Gantt Chart

Project management: showing task dependencies and overlaps

![Image](figs/week11/gantt-chart-example.png)

---

## Example: System Activity Monitoring

Tape drives and servers: visualizing concurrent processes and resource usage

![Image](figs/week11/system-activity-gantt.png)

---

# Alternative Visualizations

Heat maps and real-world examples


---

## Heat Maps for Temporal Data

**Matrix representation**: Time units as rows/columns, color encodes values

**Think of it as**: A table where one axis is time, the other is categories, and color shows the value

**Benefits**: Compact, shows patterns across multiple dimensions

![Image](figs/week11/heatmap-temporal.png)

::: notes
- **Explicit mapping**: Heat map = fancy table
  - Rows: Time units (hours, days, weeks, months)
  - Columns: Categories (states, products, sensors)
  - Cell color: The value at that time/category combination
- This is a 2D visualization of 3D data (time × category × value)
- Students often confuse heat maps with other color-based visualizations
- Key advantage: Can see patterns across BOTH dimensions simultaneously
  - Temporal patterns (when are values high?)
  - Categorical patterns (which categories have high values?)
  - Interactions (does Category A peak at different times than Category B?)
:::

---

## Example: WSJ Vaccine Impact Visualization

![Image](figs/week11/wsj-vaccine-heatmap.png)

:::footer
Wall Street Journal (2015). [*Battling Infectious Diseases in the 20th Century: The Impact of Vaccines*](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/)
:::

::: notes
- **FAMOUS EXAMPLE** - one of the most impactful data visualizations of 2015
- Shows measles cases by state (rows) over decades (columns)
- Color: disease incidence rate (darker = more cases)
- **The dramatic pattern**: Clear vertical line when vaccine was introduced - cases drop to nearly zero
- Powerfully communicates vaccine effectiveness without words
- Design choices worth noting:
  - Sorted states by total cases (puts high-burden states at top)
  - Color scale emphasizes the contrast (before/after)
  - Vertical line marks vaccine introduction
- Impact: Widely shared during vaccine debates, changed minds
- Ask: "What does this visualization communicate that a line chart couldn't?"
- Answer: Spatial patterns (which states), temporal patterns (when), and magnitude (how many) simultaneously
- This is heat maps at their best - revealing multidimensional patterns at a glance
:::

---

## Detail View

Zooming in reveals granular patterns in measles cases by state over decades

![Image](figs/week11/wsj-vaccine-detail.png)

---

## Example: FT European Football Visualization

Goals scored over careers - heat map shows performance patterns across age/seasons

![Image](figs/week11/ft-football-heatmap.png)

**How to read this visualization:**

- **X-axis**: Player's age
- **Y-axis**: Individual players (one row per player)
- **Length**: Career duration
- **Color**: Goal-scoring rate (darker = more goals)

Dense but information-rich: shows career trajectories and productivity over time


---

# Periodic Patterns

Calendars, radial layouts, and spirals

::: notes
**OPTIONAL SECTION** - If running short on time, you can skip spirals and cover calendars quickly (10 min)
- Calendars are most practical for students
- Radial layout warnings are important (5 min)
- Spirals are interesting but not essential
:::

---

## Understanding Periodicity

Often the focus is on investigating and presenting periodical patterns:

- Yearly, seasonal, monthly
- Weekly, daily, hourly


---

## Alternative Approaches

Beyond line charts: What are other solutions for periodic data?

![Image](figs/week11/periodic-alternatives.png)

---

## Calendar-Based Visualizations

**Key difference from heat maps**: Time is laid out by day-of-week and month structure

- **Heat maps**: Linear/vertical time progression
- **Calendar views**: Explicit cyclic layout (7-day weeks, 12 months)
- Better for revealing weekly/seasonal patterns

![Image](figs/week11/calendar-visualization.png)

::: notes
- Calendar views leverage our familiarity with calendar structure
- Key insight: Days of the week align vertically - easy to spot weekly patterns
- Example: Website traffic calendar - weekend days align vertically, immediately see weekend dip
- Difference from heat maps:
  - Heat maps: continuous time, arbitrary row breaks
  - Calendars: structured by weeks/months, meaningful breaks
- When to use calendars:
  - Data with strong weekly patterns (work/weekend differences)
  - Data people think about in calendar terms (appointments, events, habits)
- Limitations:
  - Only works for day-level or finer granularity
  - Months have different lengths - creates visual gaps
  - Not good for long time spans (multiple years gets unwieldy)
- Real examples: GitHub contribution calendar, fitness tracking apps, habit trackers
- Ask: "What apps use calendar views? Why does it work for them?"
:::

---

## Calendar Variations

Different ways to encode values: size, color intensity, or position within cells

![Image](figs/week11/calendar-variation-1.png)

![Image](figs/week11/calendar-variation-2.png)

---

## Radial Layouts for Periodic Data

Periodic phenomena are cyclical. Radial layouts can reduce temporal discontinuities


---

## Spiral Plots

**Key insight**: Spirals show BOTH cycles AND progression simultaneously

- **Cycles**: Annual patterns repeat at the same angle
- **Progression**: Long-term trend shows as spiral expanding/contracting outward

:::

::: notes
- **The brilliance of spirals**: They encode TWO temporal structures at once
  - **Cyclic structure**: Each complete rotation = one cycle (year, month, day)
  - **Sequential structure**: As you spiral outward = progression through time
- Temperature example (next slide):
  - Angle = month of year (seasonal cycle)
  - Radius = which year (progression)
  - Can immediately see: seasonal patterns + long-term warming trend
- Climate spiral makes this vivid: spiraling outward = getting warmer over time
- Trade-off: Harder to read precise values (radial layout limitations)
- Use when: The dual encoding (cycle + trend) is more important than precision

## Spiral Example: Temperature Data

Annual cycles spiral outward - revealing both seasonal patterns and long-term trends

## Climate Spiral Visualization

Famous example: Global temperature anomalies spiraling toward crisis thresholds

## Caution: Radial Layout Limitations

**Use circular layouts with care!**

**Research finding**: Humans are significantly slower and less accurate at judging radial distances and angles compared to linear position

Comparing values radially is harder than in Cartesian space - use only when cyclical nature is essential

::: notes
- **CRITICAL WARNING** - radial layouts look cool but are perceptually problematic
- Research shows 2-3x slower and less accurate judgments in radial vs linear layouts
- Why are they harder?
  - Angles are harder to judge than horizontal/vertical distances
  - Outer rings have more space than inner rings (same value, different visual area)
  - Hard to compare values at different angles
- When ARE they appropriate? When emphasizing cyclical nature is more important than precise reading
  - Example: 24-hour clock pattern - circular makes sense conceptually
  - Example: Climate spiral - the spiraling metaphor communicates urgency
- But for most analytical tasks: stick to linear layouts!
- Ask: "When have you seen radial visualizations in the wild? Were they effective?"
- Common misuse: Corporate dashboards with radial charts just because they look fancy

# Scalable Visualizations

Horizon charts and sparklines for dense temporal data

::: notes
**ADVANCED/OPTIONAL SECTION** - This can be assigned as reading if short on time
- Horizon charts are complex and need 15 min to walk through properly
- Sparklines are quick (5 min) and useful, show if you can
- If pressed for time: Show the horizon chart concept but assign the step-by-step as reading
- Students don't NEED to build horizon charts, but should know they exist
:::

---

## Horizon Charts

**Purpose**: Maximum data density with minimal height

Allows comparison of many time series in limited vertical space

![Image](figs/week11/horizon-chart-intro.png)

:::footer
Heer, J., Kong, N., & Agrawala, M. (2009). [*Sizing the horizon: The effects of chart size and layering on the graphical perception of time series visualizations*](https://doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518897). CHI.
:::

::: notes
- **Advanced technique** - horizon charts solve a specific problem: showing MANY time series compactly
- Problem: Line charts need vertical space - can only show ~10 series before running out of screen space
- Horizon charts compress vertical space by 2-4x while maintaining readability
- Used in: Server monitoring dashboards, financial data with hundreds of stocks, climate data arrays
- Key innovation: Trade vertical space for color intensity
- **CRITICAL**: This looks like "magic" unless you understand the construction
- **Next slides walk through step-by-step**: This is NOT optional - you MUST show the construction process
  - Without understanding HOW it's built, students will just see a confusing colored chart
  - The 4-step process (area → bands → flip → collapse) demystifies it
  - Heer et al.'s paper/video has excellent animations of this - reference them
- Takes practice to read - not intuitive at first glance
- Heer et al.'s CHI paper showed horizon charts can be as accurate as line charts but in 1/4 the space
- Real-world example: Cubism.js library for real-time dashboards
- When to use: When you have >20 time series and need to see them all simultaneously
:::

## Horizon Charts: Multiple Series

Dozens of time series in the space where only a few line charts would fit

![Image](figs/week11/horizon-chart-multiple.png)

---

## How Horizon Charts Work: Step 1

Start with a standard area chart

![Image](figs/week11/horizon-step1-area.png)

::: notes
- **SLOW DOWN**: Take your time with these construction slides
- Step 1 is familiar - just a normal area chart
- "This is what we know - a regular area chart. Now watch what happens..."
- Make sure students understand this baseline before moving forward
:::

---

## Step 2: Discretizing into Bands

Divide values into equal-height bands (e.g., 0-1, 1-2, 2-3)

![Image](figs/week11/horizon-step2-bands.png)

::: notes
- **Key transformation #1**: Chop the area into horizontal slices
- "We're dividing the chart into bands of equal height"
- Point to each band: "0-1 gets one color, 1-2 gets another, 2-3 gets a darker shade"
- This is like creating a color scale for elevation on a topographic map
- Make sure students see: Same data, just segmented into layers
:::

---

## Step 3: Flipping Negative Values

Mirror negative values above the baseline (differentiated by color/saturation)

![Image](figs/week11/horizon-step3-flip.png)

::: notes
- **Key transformation #2**: Handle negative values
- "Notice negative values? We flip them UP above the baseline"
- Use different color (or saturation) to distinguish positive from negative
- "Red/orange for positive, blue for negative" is common convention
- Why flip? Because next step collapses everything - we need both directions in same vertical space
:::

---

## Step 4: Collapsing Bands

Stack all bands on top of each other using color intensity to show magnitude

![Image](figs/week11/horizon-step4-collapse-1.png)

![Image](figs/week11/horizon-step4-collapse-2.png)

::: notes
- **THE MAGIC STEP**: Now we collapse all the bands into the same vertical space
- "All those layers we created? We stack them on top of each other"
- **This is the key insight**: Height → Color intensity
  - Band 1 (0-1): Light color
  - Band 2 (1-2): Medium color (stacked on top, shows darker)
  - Band 3 (2-3): Dark color (all three stacked)
- The result: Same temporal patterns, but 1/3 the height
- "Look at the before and after - same pattern, compressed vertically"
- This is why color intensity = magnitude in horizon charts
:::

---

## Final Result: Horizon Chart

Compact visualization preserving temporal patterns in minimal vertical space

![Image](figs/week11/horizon-final-result.png)

::: notes
- **Recap the transformation**: "We went from area chart → banded → flipped → collapsed"
- Now students should understand WHY darker colors = higher values
- "Without understanding the construction, this just looks like random colored bands"
- "But now you know: it's a compressed area chart where height became color intensity"
- Practical reading tip: Darker/more saturated = higher magnitude
- Point out: You can still see the temporal patterns (peaks and valleys), just compressed
- **Reference Heer's work**: "The original CHI paper and video show this animation - highly recommended"
:::

## Sparklines

"Small, intense, word-sized graphics with typographic resolution. Sparklines can be placed anywhere that words or numbers can be: in sentences, maps, graphics, tables."

::: notes
- **Edward Tufte's concept** - minimal, inline visualizations
- Philosophy: Data should be integrated into text, not separated
- Key characteristics:
  - No axes, no labels, no gridlines - just the trend
  - Fits inline with text (same height as text line)
  - Shows pattern at a glance, not precise values
  - "Data-intense, design-simple, word-sized"
- When to use: Tables, dashboards, reports where you want to show trend alongside numbers
- Example: Stock table showing current price + sparkline of last 30 days
- Not for: Detailed analysis, precise reading, standalone charts
- Implementation: Easy in modern tools (Excel, Tableau, D3, etc.)
- Ask students: "Where have you seen sparklines? What made them effective?"
- Common examples: Google Finance, Twitter analytics, GitHub contribution graphs

# Alternative Encodings

Beyond position: animation, color, and trajectories


---

## When Position is Already Used

All methods so far use **space** to represent time.

What if position is already taken (e.g., maps)?

---

## Three Alternative Encodings

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
**Animation**

Show changes over time through motion
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Color**

Use color/saturation to encode time
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Trajectories**

Draw paths showing movement
:::
:::

## Caution: Animation Limitations

While animation can be effective, it has significant drawbacks:

**Cognitive Limitations:**

- Limits working memory - hard to remember previous frames
- Difficult to compare non-adjacent time points
- Requires replay to catch missed details

**Best Practices:**

- Provide playback controls (pause, rewind, speed)
- Keep animations short (< 10 seconds)
- Combine with static "key frames"
- Consider small multiples instead of animation


---

# Summary

## Key Topics Covered

1. Structure of temporal data (linear, cyclic, hierarchical)
1. Line charts and variations (area charts, small multiples)
1. Heat maps/grids, calendars, circular layouts
1. Event data (dot/bubble charts, gantt)
1. Scalable visualizations: horizon, sparklines

## Key Takeaways

**Design guidelines:**

- Consider time structure (sequential, cyclic, hierarchical)
- Be cautious with stacked designs (hard to read upper layers)
- Test different aspect ratios for line charts
- Use circular layouts carefully (harder to compare values)
- Choose the right technique for the data density
