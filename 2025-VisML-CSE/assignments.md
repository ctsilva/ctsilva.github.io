## Academic Integrity

All work must be your own. You may discuss assignments with classmates and use online resources, but:

1. **Cite all sources** and collaborations in your submission
2. **Do not copy code** directly from others
3. **Be able to explain** any solution you submit
4. **Use AI tools responsibly** - disclose any AI assistance used

Violations of academic integrity will result in assignment failure and may lead to course failure.
