## Course Description

This course explores the synergy between visualization and machine learning, teaching students how to leverage visual analytics to understand, debug, and improve machine learning models. Students will learn to design and implement visualization systems for model assessment, feature analysis, and result interpretation. The course covers both theoretical foundations and practical applications, with extensive hands-on programming using modern web-based visualization tools.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Understand** the role of visualization in the machine learning pipeline
2. **Design** effective visualizations for different types of ML models and data
3. **Implement** interactive visualization systems using D3.js and modern web technologies
4. **Evaluate** ML models through visual analytics
5. **Create** visual explanations for complex ML systems
6. **Critique** existing visualization approaches for ML
7. **Develop** novel visualization techniques for emerging ML challenges

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** Strong programming skills (Python and JavaScript)
- **Required:** Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- **Recommended:** Familiarity with web technologies (HTML, CSS, SVG)
- **Recommended:** Experience with data analysis and statistics

Students without ML background should consult with the instructor before enrolling.

## Course Materials

### Required Textbook
- No required textbook. Readings will be from research papers and online resources.
