## VisML Lab Week 11 - CS-GY 9223 Fall 2025
### Deep Learning and Research Paper Writing

### Slides

The slides I showed this week can be found [here](https://ctsilva.github.io/2025-VisML-CSE/labs/week11-lab/VisML-Lab-Week11-slides). 

## Miscellaneous 
* Lab focused on deep learning visualization and research writing
* Project guidance and best practices for academic papers

## How to Write a Good Research Paper
* The ability to clearly communicate your ideas to a specific audience is a necessary skill for any profession - not just academia!
* We discussed the purpose of each section of a research paper, how to craft a good argument, and the expectations for your own research paper about your final project. See slides linked above for details

## Visualizing Deep Learning
* In lecture this week, you looked at [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.43147&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) and [CNN Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/), two visual tools for exploring the inner workings of neural networks
* We explored NeuroCartography, a tool for scalable automatic visual summarization of concepts in deep neural networks
    * The tool can be found [here](https://poloclub.github.io/neuro-cartography/)
    * The paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9552879)
* There are many other tools like this, for many different types of models:
    * [ActiVis](https://minsuk.com/research/activis/), for visual exploration of industry-scale deep neural network models
    * [Dodrio](https://poloclub.github.io/dodrio/), for visual exploration of transformer models
    * [GAN Lab](https://poloclub.github.io/ganlab/), for visualizing and understanding the inner workings of general adversarial networks
    * [Visual Auditor](https://visual-auditor.surge.sh/), for identifying and understanding biases in machine learning models
    * [Bluff](https://poloclub.github.io/bluff/), for visualizing and understanding adversarial attacks on neural networks
    * [Diffusion Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/diffusion-explainer/), for visualizing how stable diffusion turns text prompts into images
