## VisML Week 1 Lab Recap - CS-GY 9223 Fall 2025

### Miscellaneous Notes 

The slides I showed this week can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15NgbyuwDSMaK_Jat6f_nW4sMMjYMPHCmv1z-VAieWnE/edit?usp=sharing). 

Any questions about what we cover during the lab can be directed to the teaching assistant's email (TBD). 

Office hours are TBD and will be announced via course communication channels.

Please join the course communication channels for announcements and discussions. 

### Notebooks 

We walked through a few notebooks together during this week's lab, specifically [Intro to observable](https://observablehq.com/@jlrulff/introduction-to-observable), [Intro to HTML/CSS/JS](https://observablehq.com/@jlrulff/introduction-to-web-html-css-js), and a [Barplot Example](https://observablehq.com/@nyuvis/bar-chart-walk-through?collection=@nyuvis/guides-and-examples). 

### Activity

We also worked through creating a scatterplot in D3 together. This was originally meant to be an individual activity, but that plan was hindered by Observable sharing permissions (it seems that the custom URL was the issue). You should be able to view and fork your own copy of the activity [here](https://observablehq.com/d/be697ab4ff169f2a) now. I was able to access this while logged out, so I believe it should be visible to you all - if this is not the case please @ me in the Discord to let me know.   

The answer key to the activity can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/d/fc9d507d6175e57b).

### Other Resources 

The [NYUVIS Guides and Examples](https://observablehq.com/collection/@nyuvis/guides-and-examples) page is extremely helpful for all things D3. 

Note: Don't worry about absorbing all of these immediately! We will dive into more complex and interactive visualizations together as the semester continues, but this is a useful reference if you want to create a visualization but aren't sure where to start. 

However, if you are new to Javascript, I would recommend going over the [Javascript Basics](https://observablehq.com/@nyuvis/javascript-basics?collection=@nyuvis/guides-and-examples) notebook this week. If you are new to D3, I recommend taking a look at the [Data Transformation](https://observablehq.com/@nyuvis/data-transformation?collection=@nyuvis/guides-and-examples) and [SVG and D3 Basics](https://observablehq.com/@nyuvis/d3-introduction?collection=@nyuvis/guides-and-examples) notebooks - we covered some of these functions during the lab this week, but these go into more detail and introduce a few other simple but helpful functions. Building a strong understanding of the basics now will help you in future labs. 

### FAQs

Many people asked to see examples of final projects from previous semesters - these will be shared soon once we get closer to the project introduction. 

A few people also asked about the topics we'll be covering this semester, which can be found in the [Syllabus](/2025-VisML-CSE/syllabus). The topics are currently as follows:
