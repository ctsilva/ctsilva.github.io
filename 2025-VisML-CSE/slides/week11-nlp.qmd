::: {.notes}
Natural Language Processing has undergone a revolution with the advent of large language models. Today's lecture bridges traditional NLP visualization techniques with modern LLM analysis methods. We'll start with fundamental text processing concepts, then explore how visualization helps us understand both classical models like RNNs and modern transformer-based architectures. The transition from traditional NLP to LLMs represents not just a scale change but a fundamental shift in how we approach language understanding. Visualization plays a crucial role in making these black-box models more interpretable.

## NLP basics: Tasks and challenges

![](figs/week11-nlp/slide1.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
The NLP pipeline begins with raw text and transforms it through multiple stages into a form suitable for machine learning. Tokenization splits text into units (words, subwords, or characters). Normalization handles case, punctuation, and special characters. Vectorization converts tokens to numbers - from simple one-hot encoding to sophisticated contextual embeddings. Each stage involves design decisions that significantly impact downstream performance. For example, aggressive normalization might remove important signals (like capitalization indicating proper nouns), while preserving too much variation increases vocabulary size and sparsity.

![](figs/week11-nlp/slide2.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
Word embeddings revolutionized NLP by providing dense, continuous representations where similar words have similar vectors. The key insight is the distributional hypothesis: words appearing in similar contexts have similar meanings. Word2Vec uses shallow neural networks to predict context words (CBOW) or target words (Skip-gram). GloVe combines global matrix factorization with local context windows. FastText extends Word2Vec by using character n-grams, helping with out-of-vocabulary words. These embeddings capture surprising regularities - the famous "king - man + woman = queen" demonstrates that vector arithmetic can encode analogical reasoning.

sound wave (signal captured by micropones, mixing consoles, audio interfaces)
text corpus ()

phonetics/phonology (knowledge about linguistic sounds)
morphology (knowledge of the meaningful components of words)         
syntax (knowledge of the structural relationships between word)              

semantics (knowledge of meaning)
pragmatics (knowledge of the relationship of meaning to the goals and intentions of the speaker)
discourse (knowledge about linguistic units larger than a single utterance)

## NLP basics: Tasks and challenges

::: {.notes}
NLP tasks span from low-level syntactic analysis to high-level semantic understanding and generation. Token-level tasks like POS tagging and NER identify properties of individual words. Sequence-level tasks like machine translation and summarization transform entire texts. Classification tasks like sentiment analysis and topic modeling categorize documents. Generation tasks create new text. This taxonomy matters for visualization because different tasks benefit from different visual representations. Token-level tasks use attention heatmaps and dependency graphs. Document-level tasks use embedding projections and clustering visualizations. Understanding task requirements helps select appropriate models and interpretability methods.

Visualize linguistic variation between document categories in a language-independent way.
The main visualization is a scatterplot of terms, using their frequencies as position and a probabilistic score that defines how strong the connection is between a word and a category.
The authors tested it with a speech dataset from the 2012 Democratic and Republican conventions.
In this case, Scattertext can highlight linguistic style and key themes of each dataset.

2) Rule Discovery and 3) Rule Editor
   A rule is created by pattern mining that finds features combinations (rules) that frequencly occur in 'model error cases'.
   That mining is applied over semantic and syntatic features, such as dependency labels, POS-tags, semantic roles, and lexical markers.
4) Overall statistics
5) Model prediction with SHAP tokens score, raw texts, ground-truth/predicted label   
7) Concept construction enables a user to group Rules together.

## Summary: NLP Foundations

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Key Takeaways:**

1. Even if human language is convoluted, we can still build advanced NLP systems that achieve good results.
2. These systems are difficult to explain and interpret.
3. Dense representations have much more information than sparse ones, such as the meaning, position, and relations between tokens.
4. In a transformer, Q and K spaces are the mechanisms for selection (interpretable via patterns of relevance), while V space is the content being selected (abstract, combined, and thus harder to ground linguistically on its own).
