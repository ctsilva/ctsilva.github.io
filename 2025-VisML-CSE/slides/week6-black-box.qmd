# Black Box Model Assessment

## Agenda

\

### Goal: Study Model Agnostic Interpretability Methods. These should help to explain any type of ML Models.

1. Partial Dependence Plot (PDP)

2. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)

3. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)


Examples and materials from Molnar's book:
           https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/

::: {.notes}
Today we transition from white-box (interpretable) models to black-box explanation methods. These techniques work with ANY machine learning model - neural networks, ensemble methods, etc. The key distinction: white-box models are inherently interpretable, while black-box methods provide post-hoc explanations. We'll cover three major approaches: PDPs for global feature effects, LIME for local instance explanations, and SHAP for theoretically-grounded feature attribution. Each has different trade-offs between computational cost, interpretability, and theoretical guarantees.

## Bike Rentals (Regression) 

::: {.r-fit-text}
This dataset contains daily counts of rented bicycles from the bicycle rental company Capital-Bikeshare in Washington D.C., along with weather and seasonal information. The goal is to predict how many bikes will be rented depending on the weather and the day. The data can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Here is the list of features used in Molnar's book:

- Count of bicycles including both casual and registered users. The count is used as the target in the regression task.
- The season, either spring, summer, fall or winter.
- Indicator whether the day was a holiday or not.
- The year, either 2011 or 2012.
- Number of days since the 01.01.2011 (the first day in the dataset). This feature was introduced to take account of the trend over time.
- Indicator whether the day was a working day or weekend.
- The weather situation on that day. One of:
clear, few clouds, partly cloudy, cloudy
mist + clouds, mist + broken clouds, mist + few clouds, mist
light snow, light rain + thunderstorm + scattered clouds, light rain + scattered clouds
heavy rain + ice pallets + thunderstorm + mist, snow + mist
- Temperature in degrees Celsius.
- Relative humidity in percent (0 to 100).
- Wind speed in km per hour.

## Partial Dependence Plot (PDP)

Shows the marginal effect one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model (J. H. Friedman 2001).

::: {.notes}
PDPs are one of the oldest and most intuitive model-agnostic interpretation methods. The key idea: marginalize over all other features to isolate the effect of one (or two) features on the prediction. Here we see bike rentals vs temperature - notice the non-linear relationship with a sweet spot around 20-25Â°C. The visualization immediately reveals this pattern that might be hidden in model coefficients. PDPs answer: "On average, how does changing this feature affect predictions?"
:::

## Partial Dependence Plot (PDP)

High level idea: marginalizing the machine learning model output over the distributions of the all other features to show the relationship between the feature we are interested in and the predicted outcome.

This animation shows the PDP computation process step by step. For each value of our feature of interest, we: (1) Replace that feature with a fixed value across ALL data points, (2) Get predictions for all those modified instances, (3) Average those predictions, (4) Repeat for different feature values. The result is a curve showing the average effect. Notice how we're effectively "scanning" through the feature space while averaging out the effects of all other features. This is powerful because it works with any black-box model.

:::

::: {.notes}
LIME represents a paradigm shift from global to local explanations. The key insight: even if the global decision boundary is complex (left image shows a highly non-linear boundary), we can approximate it LOCALLY with a simple linear model. Think of it like approximating a curve with a tangent line - it only works near the point of tangency. The title "Why Should I Trust You?" captures the motivation: users need to understand individual predictions to build trust. LIME became hugely influential because it's model-agnostic, produces human-interpretable explanations, and works for any data type (tabular, text, images).
:::

## Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)

::: {.r-fit-text}

The idea is quite intuitive. 

- First, forget about the training data and imagine you only have the black box model where you can input data points and get the predictions of the model. You can probe the box as often as you want. Your goal is to understand why the machine learning model made a certain prediction. LIME tests what happens to the predictions when you give variations of your data into the machine learning model. 

- LIME generates a new dataset consisting of perturbed samples and the corresponding predictions of the black box model. 

- On this new dataset LIME then trains an interpretable model, which is weighted by the proximity of the sampled instances to the instance of interest. The interpretable model can be anything from the interpretable models chapter, for example Lasso or a decision tree. The learned model should be a good approximation of the machine learning model predictions locally, but it does not have to be a good global approximation. This kind of accuracy is also called *local fidelity*.

## Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)

### Algorithm

1. Pick an input that you want an explanation for.
2. Sample the neighbors of the selected input (i.e. perturbation).
3. Train a linear classifier on the neighbors.
4. The weights on the linear classifier is the explanation.

Let us look at a concrete example. We go back to the bike rental data and turn the prediction problem into a classification: After taking into account the trend that the bicycle rental has become more popular over time, we want to know on a certain day whether the number of bicycles rented will be above or below the trend line. You can also interpret âaboveâ as being above the average number of bicycles, but adjusted for the trend.

First we train a random forest with 100 trees on the classification task. On what day will the number of rental bikes be above the trend-free average, based on weather and calendar information?

The explanations are created with 2 features. The results of the sparse local linear models trained for two instances with different predicted classes:

SHAP (Lundberg and Lee 2017a) is a game-theory-inspired method created to explain predictions made by machine learning models. SHAP generates one value per input feature (also known as SHAP values) that indicates how the feature contributes to the prediction of the specified data point.

:::

::: {.notes}
SHAP brings rigorous game theory to ML interpretability. The key innovation: apply Shapley values from cooperative game theory to feature attribution. This provides a principled answer to "how much did each feature contribute?" with mathematical guarantees (efficiency, symmetry, dummy, additivity axioms). SHAP unified several existing methods under one framework. The image shows a typical SHAP force plot - red pushes prediction higher, blue pushes lower. Unlike LIME which is heuristic, SHAP has strong theoretical foundations. Trade-off: computational cost is higher, but you get provably fair attributions.

## A Short History of Shapley Values and SHAP

* 1953: The introduction of Shapley values in game theory (by Lloyd Shapley).
* 2010: The initial steps toward applying Shapley values in machine learning
  - original paper contained NO code!
* 2017: The advent of SHAP (by Lundberg and Lee), a turning point in machine learning.

## Theory of Shapley Values

Who's going to pay for that taxi?

Alice, Bob, and Charlie have dinner together and share a taxi ride home. The total cost is $51. The question is, how should they divide the costs fairly?

![](figs/black-box/shap-taxi.jpg)

::: {.notes}
The taxi example beautifully illustrates why Shapley values are "fair". Alice lives closest ($20 alone), Bob is farther ($38 with Alice), Charlie is farthest ($51 all together). A naive split ($17 each) is unfair - Alice subsidizes the others. Shapley values compute each person's marginal contribution across all possible orderings of joining the taxi. This ensures: (1) Total cost is exactly split, (2) Symmetric players pay equally, (3) Non-contributors pay nothing, (4) Values are additive. The same logic applies to features in ML: how much does each feature "contribute" to the prediction, measured fairly across all possible feature coalitions?
:::


## Theory of Shapley Values

The **marginal contribution** of a player to a coalition is the value of the coali- tion with the player minus the value of the coalition without the player. In the taxi example, the value of a coalition is equal to the cost of the ride as detailed in the above table. Therefore, the marginal contribution of, for instance, Charlie to a taxi already containing Bob is the cost of the taxi with Bob and Charlie, minus the cost of the taxi with Bob alone.

## Theory of Shapley Values

![](figs/black-box/shap-marginal-contribution.jpg)

## Theory of Shapley Values

How to average these marginal contributions per passenger?

One way to answer this question is by considering all possible permutations of Alice, Bob, and Charlie. There are 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 possible permutations of passengers:

* Alice, Bob, Charlie 
* Alice, Charlie, Bob
* Bob, Alice, Charlie
* Charlie, Alice, Bob 
* Bob, Charlie, Alice 
* Charlie, Bob, Alice

We can use these permutations to form coalitions, for example, for Alice. 

## Theory of Shapley Values

In two of these cases, Alice was added to an empty taxi, and in one case, she was added to a taxi with only Bob. By weighting the marginal contributions accordingly, we calculate the following weighted average marginal contribution for Alice, abbreviating Alice, Bob, and Charlie to A, B, and C:

## Theory of Shapley Values

for Bob:

![](figs/black-box/shap-marginal-bob.jpg)

for Charlie:

![](figs/black-box/shap-marginal-charlie.jpg)


## Calculating Shapley values

![](figs/black-box/shap-general-formation.jpg)

**The Shapley value is the weighted average of a playerâs marginal contribu- tions to all possible coalitions.**

## The axioms behind Shapley values

* Efficiency: The sum of the contributions must precisely add up to the payout.

* Symmetry: If two players are identical, they should receive equal contributions.

* Dummy or Null Player: The value of a player who doesn't contribute to any coalition is zero.

* Additivity: In a game with two value functions, the Shapley values for the sum can be expressed as the sum of the Shapley values.

**These four axioms ensure the uniqueness of the Shapley values.**

## From Shapley Values to SHAP

Consider the following scenario: You have trained a machine learning model $f$ to predict apartment prices.

We want to evaluate the effort of cat-banned

![](figs/black-box/shap-cat-banned-2.jpg)

## Interpreting SHAP values

The Shapley value can be misinterpreted. The Shapley value of a feature value is not the difference of the predicted value after removing the feature from the model training. The interpretation of the Shapley value is: **Given the current set of feature values, the contribution of a feature value to the difference between the actual prediction and the mean prediction is the estimated Shapley value.**

The Shapley value is the wrong explanation method if you seek sparse explanations (explanations that contain few features). Explanations created with the Shapley value method **always use all the features.** Humans prefer selective explanations, such as those produced by LIME. LIME might be the better choice for explanations lay-persons have to deal with.

**Key Limitations:**

- **Computational Cost**: Exponential complexity O(2^n) for exact calculation
- **Feature Independence Assumption**: Unrealistic in correlated datasets
- **Interpretation Challenges**: Values represent marginal contributions, not causal effects
- **Instability**: Small perturbations can lead to different explanations

:::

::: {.notes}
Despite SHAP's theoretical elegance, it has important limitations that practitioners must understand. The Kumar et al. paper provides crucial critiques: (1) SHAP assumes features can be independently varied, but real features are often correlated (e.g., house size and bedrooms), (2) SHAP values show associative, not causal relationships - they tell you "what" contributes but not "why", (3) Computational cost grows exponentially with features (though approximations like TreeSHAP and KernelSHAP help), (4) Explanations can be unstable under small data perturbations. Bottom line: SHAP is a powerful tool but not a magic bullet. Always validate explanations against domain knowledge.
