# Topological Data Analysis

## Today's Agenda

   - Topological equivalence and connectivity

2. **Persistence and Betti Numbers**
   - Counting holes and connected components
   - Persistence diagrams

3. **Simplicial Complexes**

4. **The Mapper Algorithm**
   - Data skeleton construction
   - Practical applications

::: {.notes}
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) provides powerful mathematical tools for understanding the "shape" of data. Unlike traditional dimensionality reduction techniques that focus on preserving distances, TDA captures global structural features like connected components, loops, and voids that persist across multiple scales. This lecture introduces two main strategies: persistent homology (analyzing how topological features appear and disappear across scales) and the Mapper algorithm (constructing data skeletons that summarize structure). These techniques have found applications in diverse fields from biology and chemistry to machine learning and data science.

## What is topology?

- Topology studies the *shape* of mathematical objects

- Unlike Geometry, it is not concerned with sizes, angles, nor coordinates

- It is concerned with the *connectivity* (or lack of) between different "parts" of the object

- Two objects are topologically equivalent if we can transform one into another with continuous transformations (without tearing the object)

![](figs/tda_figs/cube-sphere.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
Topology is often called "rubber-sheet geometry" because it studies properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformations like stretching, twisting, and bending—but not tearing or gluing. A cube and a sphere are topologically equivalent because you can continuously deform one into the other without cutting. This focus on connectivity rather than precise measurements makes topology particularly useful for analyzing high-dimensional data where exact distances may be noisy or less meaningful than structural relationships.

::: {.notes}
The classic example: a coffee mug and a donut (torus) are topologically equivalent! Both have exactly one hole. You can imagine molding the mug's handle into a ring while flattening the cup portion—all without tearing. This illustrates a fundamental topological invariant: the number of holes. In TDA, we'll formalize this intuition and use it to characterize datasets.
:::

## Why topology?

- Since topology analyzes the shape while discarding possibly unnecessary information, it is frequently used for analyzing high-dimensional objects

- Topological data analysis (TDA) uses techniques from topology to analyze datasets

- To do this, it is necessary to construct topological representations of the dataset’s points

## Why topology? - An example in chemistry

## Betti numbers

The $d^{th}$ Betti number counts the number of $d$-dimensional holes. It can be used to distinguish between spaces.

- $\beta_0(X)$ Connected components in X

- $\beta_1(X)$ Tunnels or holes in X

- $\beta_2(X)$ Voids in X

:::

::: {.notes}
Betti numbers formalize our intuition about holes. β₀ counts connected components (separate pieces), β₁ counts 1-dimensional holes (like loops or tunnels), and β₂ counts 2-dimensional voids (like hollow cavities). For example, a sphere has β₀=1 (one piece), β₁=0 (no loops), and β₂=1 (one void inside). A torus has β₀=1, β₁=2 (two independent loops), and β₂=1. These numbers provide a compact topological signature for data.

::: {.notes}
A persistence diagram is a scatter plot where each point (b,d) represents a topological feature that appeared (birth) at scale b and disappeared (death) at scale d. Points far from the diagonal represent persistent features—likely to be signal. Points near the diagonal are short-lived, often noise. This visualization provides a complete summary of how topological features evolve across scales, making it possible to automatically identify significant structures in data.

## Simplicial complexes

**Definition**

We call a non-empty family of sets $K$ with a collection of non-empty subsets $S$ an *abstract simplicial complex* if:

1. $\{v\} \in S$ for all $v \in K$
2. If $\sigma \in S$ and $\tau \subseteq \sigma$, then $\tau \in K$.

**Terminology**

The elements of a simplicial complex $K$ are called *simplices*. A $k$-simplex consists of $k+1$ verticies.

Simplicial complexes can be decomposed into their skeletons, which only contain simplices of a certain dimension.

Constructing the data's simplicial complex
:::

## Vietoris-Rips construction

**Definition**

Given a set of points $\mathcal{X} = \{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ and a metric $dist$ (such as the Euclidean distance), pick a threshold $\epsilon$ and build the Vietoris-Rips complex $\mathcal{V}_\epsilon$ defined as:

$$\mathcal{V}_\epsilon := \{\sigma \subseteq \mathcal{X} | \forall u,v \in \sigma : dist(u,v) \leq \epsilon\}$$

Equivalently, $\mathcal{V}_\epsilon$ contains all simplices whose *diameter* is less than or equal to $\epsilon$.

:::footer
Slides based on Bastian Rieck's [Topological Data Analysis for Machine Learning](https://bastian.rieck.me/talks/ecml_pkdd_2020/)
:::

::: {.notes}
The Vietoris-Rips complex transforms a point cloud into a simplicial complex. At scale ε, we connect all points within distance ε, creating edges. We then fill in triangles when three points are mutually connected, tetrahedra when four points form a complete graph, and so on. This construction captures the shape of the data at a given scale. By varying ε from 0 to infinity, we get a filtration—a sequence of nested complexes that reveals how topological features appear and disappear.
:::

## Vietoris-Rips construction

**Example**

![](figs/tda_figs/vietoris-rips-construction.png){fig-align="center"}

Draw Euclidean balls (circles) of diameter $\epsilon$ and create a $k$-simplex $\sigma$ for each subset of $k+1$ points that intersect pairwise.

- This construction dates back to a 1927 article by Leopold Vietoris$^1$

- A 2010 paper by Afra Zomorodian$^2$ describes several construction algorithms

- The basic idea is to build higher-dimensional simplices inductively from lower-dimensional ones

- In the worst case, the Vietoris-Rips complex will contain all $2^n$ subsets of its underluing point clous $\mathcal{X}$!

## Math World

\

We start in "Math World", where

- We draw the data as a smooth manifold
- Functions that appear are smooth or continuous

We will not need either of these assumptions once we are in the "Data World".

Even more importantly, data in the real world is **never** like this.

## Why is this useful?

We get "easy" understanding of the localizations of quantities of interest.

## Why is this useful?

We get "easy" understanding of the localizations of quantities of interest.

- Lenses inform us where in the space to look for phenomena.
- For easy localizations many different lenses will be informative.
- For hard (= geometrically distributed) localizations we have to be more careful. But even then, we frequently get incremental knowledge from a poorly chosen lens.

## Data World - Mapper

We need to adjust the "Math World" view to bring the algorithm into the "Data World"

- We replace points with open sets in the range of the lens
- We replace "connected component of the inverse image" with "clusters in the inverse image"
- We connect clusters (nodes) with an edge if they share points in common.

::: {.notes}
The Mapper algorithm creates a simplified graph representation of high-dimensional data by: (1) projecting data through a "lens" function (like PCA or density), (2) covering the lens range with overlapping intervals, (3) clustering points in each interval's preimage, and (4) connecting clusters that share points. The result is a network that captures the data's topological structure, making it easy to identify branches, loops, and other features. Choice of lens function is crucial—different lenses reveal different aspects of the data structure.
