## Let‚Äôs play the ‚Äúgame of 15‚Äù ...

::: incremental
* The "pieces" for the game are the nine digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Each player takes a digit in turn. Once a digit is taken, it 
cannot be used by the other player. The first player
to get three digits that sum to 15 wins.
* Here is a sample game: Player A takes 8. Player B takes 2. Then A  takes 4, and B takes 3. A takes 5.
* Question 1: Suppose you are now to step in and play for B. What move would you make?

## Let's play a different game: tic-tac-toe

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
Players alternately place an O or a X in one of nine spaces arranged in a rectangular array. Once a space has been taken, it cannot be changed by either player. The first player to get three symbols in a straight line wins. Suppose player A is X and B is O, and the game has reached the state on the right.

Question 2: Suppose you are now to step in and play an O for B. What move would you make?

* üé® **Knowing the design space**  
  *What visual encodings and techniques are available?*

  *How do people actually see and interpret visual information?*
:::
:::


::: footer
Slides based on material from Prof. Enrico Bertini
:::

## Data Types

* The first ingredient in effective visualization is the input data. Data values can represent different forms of measurement. 

* What kinds of comparisons do those measurements support? 

* What kinds of visual encodings then support those comparisons?

::: footer
Slides based on material from Prof. Jeffrey Heer [link](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/data-types-graphical-marks-and-visual-encoding-channels)
:::

## Nominal (N) or Categorical (C)

* Nominal data ‚Äî also called categorical data ‚Äî consist of category names.

* With nominal data we can compare the equality of values: is value A the same or different than value B? (A = B), supporting statements like ‚ÄúA is equal to B‚Äù or ‚ÄúA is not equal to B‚Äù. 

* When visualizing nominal data we should readily perceive if values are the same or different: position, color hue (blue, red, green, etc.), and shape are all reasonable options. 

::: footer
Slides based on material from Prof. Jeffrey Heer [link](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/data-types-graphical-marks-and-visual-encoding-channels)
:::

## Ordinal (O)

* Ordinal data consist of values that have a specific ordering.

* With ordinal data we can compare the rank-ordering of values: does value A come before or after value B? (A < B), supporting statements like ‚ÄúA is less than B‚Äù or ‚ÄúA is greater than B‚Äù. 

* When visualizing ordinal data, we should perceive a sense of rank-order. Position, size, or color value (brightness) might be appropriate, whereas color hue (which is not perceptually ordered) would be less appropriate.

::: footer
Slides based on material from Prof. Jeffrey Heer [link](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/data-types-graphical-marks-and-visual-encoding-channels)
:::

## Quantitative (Q)

* With quantitative data we can measure numerical differences among values. 

* There are multiple sub-types of quantitative data:
  - For interval data we can measure the distance between points: (A - B).
  - For ratio data we can also measure proportions or scale factors: (A / B).

* Quantitative values can be visualized using position, size, or color value, among other channels. An axis with a zero baseline is essential for proportional comparisons of ratio values, but can be safely omitted for interval comparisons.

::: footer
Slides based on material from Prof. Jeffrey Heer [link](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/data-types-graphical-marks-and-visual-encoding-channels)
:::

## Temporal (T)

* Temporal values measure time points or intervals. This type is a special case of quantitative values (timestamps) with rich semantics and conventions (i.e., the Gregorian calendar).

* Example temporal values include date strings such as ‚Äú2019-01-04‚Äù and ‚ÄúJan 04 2019‚Äù, as well as standardized date-times such as the ISO date-time format: ‚Äú2019-01-04T17:50:35.643Z‚Äù. There are no temporal values in our global development dataset above, as the year field is encoded as an integer.

::: footer
Slides based on material from Prof. Jeffrey Heer [link](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/data-types-graphical-marks-and-visual-encoding-channels)
:::

## Spatial (S)

* Data that can be shown in a map

* Also known as geospatial data, refers to information that identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features and boundaries on the Earth. [https://atlan.com/spatial-data/](https://atlan.com/spatial-data/)

## Data Types Summary

* These data types are not mutually exclusive, but rather form a hierarchy: ordinal data support nominal (equality) comparisons, while quantitative data support ordinal (rank-order) comparisons.

* Moreover, these data types do not provide a fixed categorization. For example, just because a data field is represented using a number doesn't mean we have to treat it as a quantitative type! We might interpret a set of ages (10 years old, 20 years old, etc.) as nominal (underage or overage), ordinal (grouped by year), or quantitative (calculate average age).

## Graphical Encoding

Every visualization can be described in terms of:

* its basic graphical components 
* mapping strategy between data and graphics

* more precisely, a set of mappings between:
   - data items --- visual marks
   - data attributes --- visual channels

::: footer
Slides based on material from Hadley Wickham
:::

## Graphical Marks 

![](figs/marks.jpg)

:::

## Visual Encoding Channels

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
![](figs/channels.jpg)
:::

::: footer
Slides based on material from Prof. Enrico Bertini
:::

## Visualization Decoding

* Marks --- Data Items

* Channels --- Data Attributes

::: footer
Slides based on material from Prof. Enrico Bertini

## Examples

::: footer
Slides based on material from Prof. Enrico Bertini
:::

## Expressiveness Principle

The visual representation should express the type of information that exists in the data. 

* Ordered data should not appear as unordered.
* Unordered data should not appear as ordered.

## Effectiveness Principle

Relevance of information should match the effectiveness of the channels used.

- Represent important information with more effective channels

## Effectiveness Effect

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
![](figs/effectiveness.jpg)
:::

## Summary

* Visual Encoding/Decoding
* Graphical Marks and Channels
* Expressiveness and Effectiveness
* Channels Appropriateness and Ranking
* Evaluation and Design
* Contextual Components
  - Labels, legends and annotations
  - Axes, grids and trend lines
