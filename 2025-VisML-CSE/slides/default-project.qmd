## Project Overview

**Visual Analytics for AI-Generated Urban Infrastructure Maps**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Goal
Design and build visualization systems to help domain experts understand, debug, and analyze ML pipelines that generate urban infrastructure maps from aerial imagery.

### The Tool
**Tile2Net**: A semantic segmentation system that extracts pedestrian networks from aerial imagery.

# Motivation

## Why Urban Infrastructure Maps Matter

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Current Challenges

- Manual mapping is **slow** and **expensive**
- Data gaps in pedestrian infrastructure
- Outdated city datasets
- Accessibility planning requires detailed data
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Solution

**Semantic Segmentation** + **Aerial Imagery**

Automatically classify every pixel:

- Roads
- Buildings
- Sidewalks
- Crosswalks
- Vegetation
:::

## The Tile2Net Pipeline

![](figs/default-project/tile2net-pipeline.jpg)

**State-of-the-art tool** for extracting sidewalk and crosswalk networks from aerial imagery

# The Challenge

## The Black Box is Brittle

Multi-stage ML systems can introduce and compound errors at each stage:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Stage 1: Image Ingestion
- Different lighting conditions
- Seasonal variations
- Resolution mismatches

### Stage 2: Segmentation
- Occlusions (trees, shadows)
- Faded markings
- Construction zones
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Stage 3: Raster-to-Polygon
- Geometric artifacts
- Boundary smoothing errors
- Feature simplification issues

### Stage 4: Polygon-to-Network
- Disconnected components
- Incorrect topology
- Jagged centerlines
:::
::::

## The Problem

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
### Limited Reliability

- Errors cascade through pipeline
- Hard to identify failure points
- Difficult to validate outputs
- Reduced trust from urban planners
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
### Your Mission

Build **interactive visualization tools** to:

- Understand model behavior
- Debug pipeline stages
- Analyze output quality
- Increase trustworthiness
:::

# Project Ideas

## Three Potential Directions

You can choose **one** direction or propose a hybrid/variation:

::: {.incremental}
1. **Idea A**: The Segmentation Detective
   - Diagnose pixel-level segmentation failures

2. **Idea B**: The Network Quality Inspector
   - Assess topological and geometric quality

3. **Idea C**: The Urban Time Traveler
   - Analyze infrastructure evolution over time
:::

# Idea A: The Segmentation Detective

## Goal & Key Questions

### Goal
Build a visual analytics tool to **diagnose and understand failures** of the semantic segmentation model at the pixel and tile level.

### Key Questions
::: {.incremental}
- Where does the model **succeed** and where does it **fail**?
- What visual features correlate with specific error types?
- How does prediction **confidence** relate to **accuracy**?
- How do environmental factors (shadows, tree cover) impact performance?
:::

## Potential Features

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Linked Views Dashboard
- Original aerial image
- Ground-truth annotations
- Model predictions
- Confidence maps

### Error Overlay
- Highlight false positives
- Highlight false negatives
- Color-coded by error type
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Interactive Tools
- Filter by error type
- Filter by confidence threshold
- Isolate problem regions

### Magnification Lens
- Focus on specific regions
- View all layers simultaneously
- Compare predictions vs. truth
:::
::::

# Idea B: The Network Quality Inspector

## Goal & Key Questions

### Goal
Create a visualization tool to assess the **topological and geometric quality** of the final pedestrian network graph.

### Key Questions
::: {.incremental}
- Where are breaks or **disconnected components**?
- Are **intersections** generated correctly?
- Can we flag geometric **anomalies** automatically?
- How does the network compare to **baselines** (e.g., OpenStreetMap)?
:::

## Potential Features

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Quality-Coded Map
- Color edges/nodes by metrics
- Connectivity indicators
- Smoothness measures
- Segment length analysis

### Automatic Flagging
- Dead-end detection
- Isolated subgraphs
- Click to inspect imagery
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Network Comparison
- Diff view vs. OpenStreetMap
- Diff view vs. city data
- Overlay reference networks

### Graph Metrics
- Node degree distribution
- Betweenness centrality
- Network connectivity
- High-level quality overview
:::

# Idea C: The Urban Time Traveler

## Goal & Key Questions

### Goal
Design a visual tool for analyzing the **evolution** of urban pedestrian infrastructure over time using historical aerial imagery.

### Key Questions
::: {.incremental}
- How has the pedestrian network **changed** over the last decade?
- Where have sidewalks/crosswalks been **added or removed**?
- Can we correlate changes with city **planning initiatives**?
- How do **walkability metrics** change over time?
:::

## Potential Features

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Visual Diff Map
- Highlight changes between time periods
- Show added paths (green)
- Show removed paths (red)
- Show modified paths (yellow)

### Timeline Animation
- Slider control
- Animate network evolution
- Year-by-year transitions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Temporal Dashboard
- Network map view

- Track metrics over time:
  - Total sidewalk length
  - Network density
  - Number of intersections

### Case Study Example
Cambridge, MA: 23% change in crosswalks over 8 years
