## The Act of Perception

* Botton-Up and Top-Down Processes

## The Act of Perception

* Bottom-up: information is sucessively selected and filtered into patterns as it passes a sequence of stages. Ware outlines three stages: 1) optical nerve to V1 Cortex; 2) use texture and colors to aggregate *patterns*; 3) visual objects are recognized in the *visual working memory*.

## The Act of Perception

* Top-Down: Every stage of bottom-up processing contains a corresponding top-down process. Ware describes the process as "attention". The dominant principle is that we only get the information that we need, when we need it.

## The Implications for Design

* "Just-in-time visual queries" (Ware)

* "One way to look at the brain operates is a set of nested loops. Outer loops deal with generality while inner loops process detail." (Ware)

## Low-Level Feature Analysis

* David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel won Nobel prize for this discovery.

## What and Where Pathways

* What: identification of objects in environment.
* Where: location of objects and eye movement.

## What Stands Out (Popout)

* Anne Triesman studied how to find patterns and shapes when surrounded by others.

For some configurations the time *did not* depend on the number of distracters (pre-attentive).

## The Gestalt Principles [link, see video](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles)

* Visualization is a two-way street:
  - We (the vis designer) bring something to the table.
  - The human (end user) brings their prior experience.
* Design should take such prior experience into account!
* What is prior experience? Gestalt laws.

## Closure

* We can complete incomplete shapes

![](figs/closure.jpg)

* Implications: visualizations can be unintentionally misleading! Conversely: sometimes only necessary to show sparse set of marks to convey trend (dot plot)

## Similarity

* Elements with the same visual properties considered to be grouped

## Proximity

* Elements that are of close spatial proximity are somehow grouped.

## Just Noticeable Difference (JND)

* In psychophysics a just-noticeable difference or JND is the amount something must be changed in order for a difference to be noticeable, detectable at least half the time. 

* Stevens's power law: [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%27s_power_law)

## Accuracy

* Position > Length and Angle > Area

* Prioritize high-rank channels (with reason)

* Do not expect precise judgments from low-rank channels

## Effectiveness Effect

![](figs/effectiveness.jpg)

## Discriminability

* How many distinct values can be distinguished within a channel

* It depends on:
  - Channel properties
  - Spatial arrangement
  - Size (resolution)
  - Cardinality

* Warning: Do not overestimate the number of values viewers can perceive/discriminate

::: footer
Slides based on material from Prof. Enrico Bertini
:::

## Discriminability

* Many channels, in particular identity channels, can only support a limited number of discriminable levels.
    - Line width is one of the most limited with perhaps 3 levels.
    - Using more than 5 or 6 color hues is not recommended.
    - Similarly, using more than 5 or 6 symbol shapes can create difficulties.
* If the number of levels that can be represented by a channel is smaller than the number of attribute levels then some form of meaningful aggregation is needed.

## Popout

* Tasks performed in less than 200 to 250 milliseconds.

* Faster than eyes movement initiation.

* Suggest processing by parallel low-level visual system.
