## Course Description

This course explores the intersection of visualization and machine learning, focusing on how visualization techniques can help understand, debug, and improve machine learning models. Students will learn to create visual analytics systems for model assessment, feature analysis, and result interpretation. Topics include visualization for model performance, feature importance, clustering, dimensionality reduction, deep learning architectures, and interpretable AI.

## Prerequisites

- Solid programming skills (Python and JavaScript)
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with web technologies (HTML, CSS) helpful but not required
