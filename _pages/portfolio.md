Although I started as a mathematician, I have a passion for developing software systems. I am particularly interested in systems that involve human interaction.

Software (Source Code)
======
*Note: This section currently contains mostly historical software (pre-2011) and will be updated.*

* [VisTrails](http://www.vistrails.org)
* [AFront](http://afront.sourceforge.net) - Advancing front surface reconstruction, by Schreiner, Scheidegger, Fleishman and others
  * [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ctsilva/afront)
* [HAVS](http://havs.sourceforge.net) - Implementation of the Hardware-Assisted Visibility Sorting (HAVS) algorithm for rendering unstructured grids, by Callahan, Ikits, and others. (Note: Also available in VTK as [vtkHAVSVolumeMapper](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkHAVSVolumeMapper.html))
* GPU-based ray caster for Unstructured Meshes, by Bernardon and Comba
* TetMesh Comparator (tmc) - For measuring errors between two tet meshes, by Louis Bavoil
* GTB: Graphics Toolbox - Includes implementation of Correa's PhD thesis (in particular, iWalk)
* GcTin - Greedy-Cuts terrain triangulation
  * [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ctsilva/gctin)
* ZSWEEP - Implementation by R. Farias of the ZSWEEP algorithm. (Note: Kitware has implemented ZSWEEP in VTK as [vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper.html), which is fully integrated into both VTK and ParaView and is the preferred way to generate high-quality images of unstructured grids)
  * [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ctsilva/demo-zsweep)
* Raytrace - Unstructured-grid ray tracer, by Bunyk. (Also implemented in VTK as [vtkUnstructuredGridBunykRayCastFunction](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUnstructuredGridBunykRayCastFunction.html))
  * [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ctsilva/raytrace)
  * [spx.off](spx.off) - Sample dataset
* Vertex program source code for rendering a tetrahedron by Wylie et al (See their paper at VolVis 2002 for details)
* oocsx.m - Partial Mathematica implementation of the OoCSx algorithm
