## About Me

I am Institute Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and Data Science at New York University. Born in Brazil, I've been in the United States for over 30 years, bringing a global perspective to my research and teaching.

My research interests are broad and inherently interdisciplinary. Within computer science, I focus on visualization, visual analytics, machine learning, reproducibility and provenance, geometric computing, urban computing, computer graphics, and computer vision. I particularly enjoy working at the intersection of different fields, recently collaborating with paleontologists, urban scientists, and sports scientists. I take great satisfaction in building tools that others can use to advance their own research and solve real-world problems.

## Academic Background

I received my BS in Mathematics from the Universidade Federal do Ceará (Brazil) in 1990, and my MS and PhD in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1996. Prior to joining NYU in 2011, I was with the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute at the University of Utah.

## Leadership and Impact

I was a co-founder of NYU's [Center for Data Science (CDS)](http://cds.nyu.edu) and the [Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP)](http://cusp.nyu.edu). Currently, I serve as Co-Director of the [Visualization, Imaging and Data Analysis (VIDA) Center](http://vida.engineering.nyu.edu), located on the 11th floor of 370 Jay Street in Brooklyn, NY. I am also part of [ai@nyu](https://cims.nyu.edu/ai/).

A significant part of my career has been dedicated to mentoring the next generation of researchers through advising doctoral and masters students, as well as collaborating with post-doctoral associates.

## Recognition and Service

I am a Fellow of both the ACM (2024) and IEEE (2013), and have received the IEEE Visualization Technical Achievement Award. I served as the elected Chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on Visualization and Computer Graphics from 2015–2018.

From 2012-2017, I was the senior technology consultant for MLB Advanced Media's Statcast player tracking system, which received a 2018 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS). Our lab's work has been featured in major media outlets including The New York Times, The Economist, and ESPN.
