I am a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and Data Science at New York University. I was a co-founder of the [Center for Data Science (CDS)](http://cds.nyu.edu) and the [Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP)](http://cusp.nyu.edu).

I am Co-Director of the [Visualization, Imaging and Data Analysis (VIDA) Center](http://vida.engineering.nyu.edu). We are located in the 11th floor of 370 Jay Street in Brooklyn, NY. 

I am also part of [ai@nyu](https://cims.nyu.edu/ai/).

Current major projects:

- [OpenSpace](https://www.openspaceproject.com) (funded by NASA)

- [OSCUR: Open-Source Cyberinfrastructure for Urban Computing](https://oscur.org/)

- [ARPA-H Biomedical Data Fabric Toolbox] (https://arpa-h.gov/explore-funding/programs/arpa-h-bdf-toolbox)

Recent projects:

- [DARPA Perceptually-enabled Task Guidance (PTG)](https://www.darpa.mil/program/perceptually-enabled-task-guidance)

- [Sounds of New York City](https://wp.nyu.edu/sonyc) (funded by NSF)

- Explainable AI (in collaboration with the Center for Machine Learning at Capital One)

I am also active in sports analytics. I started work in this area as a Technology Consultant for [MLB Advanced Media's Statcast system](https://www.newsweek.com/2014/09/12/can-baseball-get-more-interesting-watch-big-data-267590.html), but my interests have expanded beyond baseball.
