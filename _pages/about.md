I am Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and Data Science at New York University. I joined NYU 10+ years ago, and helped to start the [Center for Data Science (CDS)](http://cds.nyu.edu) and the [Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP)](http://cusp.nyu.edu).

My research group is part of the [Visualization, Imaging and Data Analytics (VIDA) Center](http://vida.engineering.nyu.edu), and it is located in the 11th floor of 370 Jay Street in Brooklyn, NY.
