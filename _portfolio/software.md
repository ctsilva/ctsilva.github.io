## Research Software

### VisTrails
**[www.vistrails.org](http://www.vistrails.org)**
A scientific workflow and provenance management system that provides support for data exploration and visualization.

### AFront
**[afront.sourceforge.net](http://afront.sourceforge.net)**
Advancing front surface reconstruction. By Schreiner, Scheidegger, Fleishman and others.

### HAVS (Hardware-Assisted Visibility Sorting)
**[havs.sourceforge.net](http://havs.sourceforge.net)**
Implementation of the Hardware-Assisted Visibility Sorting (HAVS) algorithm for rendering unstructured grids. By Callahan, Ikits, and others.
*Note: Also available in VTK as [vtkHAVSVolumeMapper](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkHAVSVolumeMapper.html)*

### GPU-based Ray Caster for Unstructured Meshes
By Bernardon and Comba

### TetMesh Comparator (tmc)
Tool for measuring errors between two tetrahedral meshes. By Louis Bavoil.

### GTB: Graphics Toolbox
Includes implementation of Correa's PhD thesis, particularly iWalk algorithm.

### GcTin
Greedy-Cuts terrain triangulation implementation.

### ZSWEEP
**Implementation by R. Farias**
Original implementation of the ZSWEEP algorithm for rendering unstructured grids.
*Note: Kitware has implemented ZSWEEP in VTK as [vtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUnstructuredGridVolumeZSweepMapper.html). This VTK version is fully integrated into both VTK and ParaView and is the preferred way to generate high-quality images of unstructured grids.*

### Unstructured-Grid Ray Tracer
**By Bunyk**
Ray tracing implementation for unstructured grids.
*Note: Also implemented in VTK as [vtkUnstructuredGridBunykRayCastFunction](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkUnstructuredGridBunykRayCastFunction.html)*
[Sample dataset: spx.off](spx.off)

### Vertex Program for Tetrahedron Rendering
Source code of Wylie et al's vertex program for rendering a tetrahedron.
See their paper at VolVis 2002 for details.

### OoCSx Algorithm
**oocsx.m**
Partial Mathematica implementation of the OoCSx (Out-of-Core Simplification) algorithm.
