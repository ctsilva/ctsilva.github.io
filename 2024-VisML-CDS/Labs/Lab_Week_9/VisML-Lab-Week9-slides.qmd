## Miscellaneous 

* Homework 4 (on dimensionality reduction) will be released next week. It will NOT be mandatory - complete it by April 19th for extra credit
* Homework 3 is being graded 
* **Project proposal due 4/4** - please submit the names of your project team [here](https://forms.gle/WvUgBjRpNUDGkNdQA) by the end of today! Only one person from each team needs to complete the form.
* I will be holding **office hours at 2pm Tuesday and Thursday** next week - reach out if you want to discuss your proposal and neither time works for you 

## Topological Data Analysis (TDA)
- Data has shape, and that shape matters when we analyze it
- A way of extracting meaning from high dimensional data 
- Slides adapted from Shaw Talebi's [TDA video trilogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpL5fMmJHqk&list=PLzERW_Obpmv_UW7RgbZW4Ebhw87BcoXc7&ab_channel=ShawTalebi).

## Persistent Homology
- TDA is about looking at the shape of data 
- All polygons can be broken down into the simplest shape - a triangle
- If we want to analyze the shape of our data, we can break it down into triangles - this is the idea behind persistent homology 
![](ph_1.png)

## Persistent Homology
- But most datasets have more than two dimensions, so 2D triangles would not capture them
- Instead we use simplexes - triangles generalized to any number of dimensions
![](ph_2.png)

## Persistent Homology
- We can use collections of simplexes (simplicial complexes) to describe our data
![](ph_3.png)

## Persistent Homology
- How do we compare these complex shapes?

## Persistent Homology
- How do we compare these complex shapes?
- These shapes can be characterized by their holes - we can compare them by counting their holes
![](ph_4.png)

## Persistent Homology
- The concept of "hole" can also be generalized to any dimension:
![](ph_5.png)

## Persistent Homology
- The concept of "hole" can also be generalized to any dimension (in 1 dimension we count connected components):
![](ph_6.png)

## Persistent Homology
- To perform persistent homology, we first draw n-dimensional circles around each point:
![](ph_7.png)

## Persistent Homology
- We can then create 1-simplexes by connecting the data points whose circles overlap:
![](ph_8.png)

## Persistent Homology
- Now we have two shapes: our initial 0-simplex (point cloud) and a shape made of 0- and 1-simplexes
![](ph_8.png)

## Persistent Homology
- We can compare their homologies by counting the number of connected components:
![](ph_9.png)

## Persistent Homology
- We repeat this step, increasing the radius of the circles
- We see 2-simplexes start to appear and the number of connected components decreases:
![](ph_10.png)

## Persistent Homology
- We can do this for every choice of radius between 0 and the radius which yields only one connected component:
![](ph_11.png)

## Persistent Homology
- This allows us to analyze which topological features of our data are significant based on how long they "persist" during the circle-growing process (longer persistence = more significant)
![](ph_11.png)

## Persistence Diagram
- Points close to y=x are noise, points far from y=x are significant
