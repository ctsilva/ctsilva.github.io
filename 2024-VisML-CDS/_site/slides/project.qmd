## The Final Project

You either:

* Do the **default** project (more on this later)

* Propose your own final project, which we must approve

  - For this, you will need a mentor (TA/prof/postdoc/PhD)

You can work in teams 1-3. Teams are encouraged. Obviously, more is expected from a team than an individual.

## Custom Final Projects

* You will need to talk to me or one of the following people about approval for a custom project:

  - Erin McGowan
  - Vitoria Guardiero
  - Guande Wu
  - Joao Rulff 
  - Parikshit Solunke

* If you intend to do one, please reach out immediately.

## Why Choose the Default Final Project (DFP)

* If you have limited experience with research, don’t have a clear idea of what you want to do, or need guidance and a goal… Then do the default final project!

*  Considerations:
   - The final project will give you more guidance, scaffolding, and clear goals to aim at
   - The path of success is not to do something that looks weak compared to what you could have done with the DFP

## Why do Custom Final Project (CFP)?

* If you
   - Have some research project that you’re very excited about, which involves the class topics
   - You want to try something on your own
   - You want to see more of the process of defining your own research goal, finding data and tools, etc
* Then
   - Do the custom project

## Gamesmanship

* DFP are a more guided option, but it’s not that they’re less work
* DFP are also open-ended projects where you can explore different approaches and your own creativity. 
* There are great DFP and great CFP… and weak DFP and CFP. 
* We will be giving a Best Project Award for each type of project (assuming quantify and quality of entries)

## Project Proposal

* Find a relevant (key) research paper for your topic
   - For DFP, those are provided
* Write a summary of that research paper and what you took away from it as key ideas that you hope to use
* Write what you plan to work on, and how you can innovate in your final project
* Describe as needed, in particular for CFP.
   - Project plan, relevant existing literature, data that you will use, how you will evaluate your work

## Project Proposal

* Skill: How to think critically about a research paper
  - What were the main novel contributions?
  - Is the work general and reusable or a special case?
  - Are there flaws or neat details in that they did?
  - How does it fit with other papers on similar topics?
  - Does it provoke good questions on further or different things to try?

## Project Proposal

* How to do a good job on your project plan?
   - You need to have an overall sensible idea
   - But most project plans are lacking in nuts-and-bolts:
      * Do you have your data? Can you collect it quickly?
      * Do you have a realistic evaluation plan? Is it convincing?
      * Do you have appropriate baselines?

## Project Writeup

* Writeup quality is very important to your grade!
