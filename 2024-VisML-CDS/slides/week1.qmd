- Feel free to direct message for anything else.

## Course Prerequisites

- Solid programming expertise.

- The coursework includes extensive programming with JavaScript and D3.js. To be covered in the labs.

- We will also expect students to be able to program in Python.

- Basic knowlege of machine learning.

## Course Description 

- Our course is based on foundations of visual analytics, which is an area of data visualization that is concerned with improving the human analytic process. 

- Visual analytics is concerned with combining automated processes with human-driven processes that are built around data visualization: visual representations of data, and ways to interact with data. 

## Course Objectives 

- This course is designed to sharpen a student's knowledge of visualization. 

- We aim to make the student a more effective data scientist. 

- The course has a major project, which will help the student develop research skills.

## Course Structure 

- The course include lectures and labs. We will strive to have hands-on sessions to complement theoretical materials.

- Starts with a short primer on visualization. 

- Then we will cover techniques for visualizing  model assessment, white-box and black-box machine learning explainers, and dimensionality reduction.

- Second half of the course has more advanced topics, including Topology Data Analysis and techniques for visualizing deep neural networks. 

## Reading Material

* There is no textbook for the course.

* We will have suggested reading materials for each class. 

* Supplemental readings to be used as reference material:

  - Data Visualization Curriculum, Heer, [link](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/data-visualization-curriculum)

  - A Course in Machine Learning, Daume, [link](http://ciml.info/dl/v0_99/ciml-v0_99-all.pdf)

  - Interpretable Machine Learning, Molnar, [link](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)

  - Introduction to Machine Learning, Bernard, [link](https://www.wolfram.com/language/introduction-machine-learning/)

  - Deep Learning, Goodfellow et al, [link](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

## Research Project

- Course includes a substantial research project. 

- Projects are expected to be pursued in groups of 2-3. 

- Once the group is finalized, students cannot change or separate their groups throughout the semester.

## Course Assessment

* Assignments (50%)
* Project Proposal (4-page writeup): 10%
* Project Updates (1-page writeup): 10%
* Full Project (up to 8-page writeup): 25%
* Class Participation: 5%

## Late Submissions

Late submissions of assignments will be penalized as follows:

- A standard deduction rate of 20% per day. It means that after 5 days of being late, your assignment will have a maximum grade of 0 (zero).

- You will have a one-time exception for submitting assignments late (up to 5 days late).

## Academic Integrity

- All students are expected to do their own work.

- See detailed policy on class syllabus.

- Also, here is a [link to the GSAS statement on Academic Integrity](https://gsas.nyu.edu/about-gsas/policies-and-procedures/gsas-statement-on-academic-integrity.html). 

## AI policy

- You can use generative AI tools to do the assignments in this class. 

- If you use an AI to guide you in completing an assignment, you have to disclose which parts were generated by the AI.Â 

## NYU Academic Calendar

- [link to NYU Academic Calendar](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/academic-calendar.html?semester=Spring%202024)

- This course does not have a final exam, but there will be a final project presentation.

- Also, please pay attention to notable dates such as Add/Drop, Withdrawal, etc.
