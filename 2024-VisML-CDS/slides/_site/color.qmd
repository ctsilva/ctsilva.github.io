## Visible Spectrum

![](figs/visiblespectrum.jpg)

## Light

* Visible range: 390-700nm

* Luminance has a large dynamic range:

  – 0.00003 -- Moonless overcast night sky 

  – 30 -- Sky on overcast day

  – 3000 -- Sky on clear day

  – 16,000 -- Snowy ground in full sunlight

* Colors result from spectral curves 

  – dominant wavelength, hue

  – brightness, lightness

  – purity, saturation

## Physiology of the Eye

## The Retina

## Photoreceptors

* Discrete sensors that measure energy 
  – Adaptation
* Rods
  - active at low light levels (scotopic vision)
  - only one wavelength-sensitivity function
* Cones
  - active at normal light levels (photoptic)
  - three types: sensitivity functions with different peaks

## Color in Visualization

* Trichromacy: Humans perceive colors according to three channels

* Most usable and useful way to describe colors (especially for visualization):
  - Hue, Saturation, Luminance

## Quantitative Color Scales

* Desired Properties of Quantitative Color Scale:
  - Uniformity (value difference = perceived difference)
  - Discriminability (as many distinct values as possible)

## Single Hue Sequential Scales

* Choose one hue
* Map value to luminance

## Categorical Color Scales

* Properties:
  - Uniformity (uniform saliency / nothing stands out)
  - Discriminability (as many distinct values as possible)

## Categorical Color Scales

* How many distinct values can one perceive?

* how many can you use in a visualization?

* Estimates are between 5-10 distinct codes.

## Diverging Color Scales

* Sometime useful/necessary to distinguish values above and below a threshold.

## Color Blindness

* Missing or defective photoreceptors:
   - 10% male and 1% female have some color deficiencies
